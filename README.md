# Inspector

A C# console application allowing users to search for various social network sites based on a specified username.

# Usage

$ git clone https://github.com/jeremyolu/Inspector.git

Open Inspector.sln and run application within your desired IDE.

# Implementation

The console app has been implemented in a way that is simple and easy to use. A list of predifined social network links are used to search for accounts based on a username. In order to determine for sure if a account exists with that username, a GET request is made to the various social network links. If a 200 status code is returned then the account is returned in the results.
